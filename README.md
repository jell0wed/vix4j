# Vix4J

Vix4J is a high-level Java wrapper around the VMware Vix API allowing the developpers to manage programatically their virtual machine under VMware virtualization platforms. This wrapper uses the native Vix libraries from the Vix SDK using the Java Native Access (JNA) - available at https://github.com/twall/jna. The wrapper is aimed to be easy to use and abstract to a higher level virtual machine manipulation operations on the VMware virtualization solutions.

### Product Support
